### What are Phoenix and Elixir?

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language that is designed for building scalable and mainainable applications. The great part about it is, thanks to the simplified way of running the code, called processes, Elixir can run hundreds and thousands of processes concurrently. 

Phoenix is a modern web framework built with Elixir that makes building APIs and web applications easy. It is built on the Erlang VM, and used for building low-latency and fault-tolerant systems.

### Why?

The reason I decided to learn Phoenix and Elixir is because I like working with frameworks a lot. React is super fluid and easy to use, and I love seeing realtime updates to what I'm working on. I figured that an expansion into another framework would only help me in the long run, so that's why I made the decision I did.

### How?

To learn Phoenix and Elixir, I first walked through a bit of the basic tutorials on the Phoenix website, just to get a handle on it. After that, I figured it wouldn't be too hard to make a simple app, so I goodled "Simple Apps In Phoenix" and found an step-by-step guide on making a chatroom app. The guide explained everything thoroughly and I understood the why and how of everything I was doing.
